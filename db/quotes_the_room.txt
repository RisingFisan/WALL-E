I did not hit her, it's not true, it's bullshit, I did not hit her, I DID NOT!
Oh hi Mark!
-----
HA HA what a story Mark!
-----
YOU ARE TEARING ME APART LISA!
-----
Don't touch me motherfucker.
-----
I'm fed up with this world.
-----
I'm so happy I have you as my best friend, and I love Lisa so much.
-----
You don't understand anything, man. Leave your stupid comments in your pocket!
-----
In a few minutes, bitch.
Who are you calling a bitch?!
You and your stupid mother.
-----
Did you get your promotion?
Nah.
You didn't get it, did you?
-----
Anyway, how's your sex life?
-----
Nobody wants to help me, and I'm dying!
You're not dying, mom.
I got the results of the test back. I **definitely** have breast cancer.
-----
Why, Lisa, why?
-----
Hi doggy!
-----
You're my favorite customer.
-----
Chicken, Peter, youâ€™re just a little chicken. Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep!
-----
Oh hi Johnny, I didn't know it was you.
-----
If a lot of people love each other, the world would be a better place to live.
-----
Do you understand life?! Do you?!
-----
YOU'RE NOT MY FUCKING MOTHER!!
-----
You look beautiful today. Can I kiss you?
